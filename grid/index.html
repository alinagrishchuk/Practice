               <h2>The Wicked Prince</h2>
              <p>
                  THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the
                  countries of the world, and on frightening the people. He devastated their countries with fire and
                  sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants’ huts by fire,
                  so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the
                  singed black trees. Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in her arms, behind the still smoking
                  walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served
                  as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things
                  than these soldiers! The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural
                  course which things ought to take. His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and
                  fortune favoured his deeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                   He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated
                   in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled. He erected magnificent palaces, churches,
                   and halls, and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly, “What
                   a mighty prince!” But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries,
                   nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.
              </p>
               <p>
                   The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent buildings, and thought,
                   like the crowd, “What a mighty prince! But I must have more — much more. No power on earth must
                   equal mine, far less exceed it.”
                   He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them. The conquered kings were chained up with
                   golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city. These kings had to
                   kneel at his and his courtiers’ feet when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they
                   left. At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal
                   palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches – on the altars, but in this the priests
                   opposed him, saying, “Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God’s power is much greater than yours;
                   we dare not obey your orders.”
               </p>
              <p>
                  “Well,” said the prince. “Then I will conquer God too.” And in his haughtiness and foolish presumption,
                  he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air. It was
                  gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands
                  of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun. The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only
                  to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were
                  at once loaded again. Hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness
                  of an arrow up towards the sun. The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains
                  and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon
                  it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it. At last it entirely disappeared in mist
                  and clouds. Higher and higher rose the eagles up into the air, then God sent one of his numberless
                  angels against the ship. The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded
                  from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones. One drop of blood, one single drop,
                  came out of the white feathers of the angel’s wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat,
                  burned into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to
                  the earth again. The strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared around the prince’s head,
                  and the clouds around — were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burned cities? Took strange
                  shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like
                  enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.
